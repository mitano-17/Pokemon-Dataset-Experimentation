# Pokemon-Dataset-Experimentation

This is a continuation of the project that uses the **`Complete Pokemon Dataset (Updated 16.04.21)`** dataset submitted back in the 21st of November 2022.

The link to the dataset is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420?resource=download by Mario Tormo Romero.

The processes done in the first notebook are as follows: <b>📝 Dataset Description 📝, 🧽 Dataset Cleaning 🧽, 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis 📊, and 🤔 Research Question 🤔</b>.

<h2>🤔 Research Question 🤔</h2>
<h3 style="color: #ff8d8c">What is the relation between pokemon generation and type 1 element to health points, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed?</h3>
This research question aims to find which generation and type 1 element element is best to use based on the pokemons' statistics on total points, health points, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed. 

It may be difficult for persons to choose which pokemon is best to use because there are over 1000 pokemons as observed in the dataset. To rely only on one single pokemon with the strongest statistic is not the best solution because there are many different factors to choose which pokemon is best on certain situations. With that, a solution will be made by checking which generation and type 1 element is best to use based on the statistics provided in the pokemon dataframe, mainly health points, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed.
